# bipedalrobot
Training a virtual bipedal robot to walk in OpenAI Gym using Evolution Strategies (ES). 

Credit goes to [alirezamika](https://github.com/alirezamika/bipedal-es) for writing most of the code. I added documentation and optimized hyperparameters.

Feel free to tweak the hyperparameters in agent.py and see if you get a better reward.
The currently trained model gets a total reward of Â±190.

# Dependencies

To use this model you have to install [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and the [Evostra repository](https://github.com/alirezamika/evostra) of [alirezamika](https://github.com/alirezamika):

    pip install evostra
    pip install gym

# Training 
Type in command line:

    python agent_train.py
    
The program trains standard for 200 iterations. If you want you can change the amount of iterations in agent_train.py by changing the 'n' variable.

# Testing / Playing
Type in command line:

    python agent_play.py
    
The program plays one episode. If you want to change the number of episodes, change the 'n' variable in agent_play.py.
