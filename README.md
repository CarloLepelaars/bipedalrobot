# bipedalrobot
Training a virtual bipedal robot to walk in OpenAI Gym using Evolution Strategies (ES)

Creating for the model goes to [alirezamika](https://github.com/alirezamika/bipedal-es) for most of the code. I just added some documentation and optimezed a few hyperparameters.

Feel free to tweak the hyperparameters in agent.py and see if you get a better reward.
The currently trained model has a total reward of Â±190.

# Training 
Type in command line:

    python agent_train.py
    
The program trains standard for 200 iterations. If you want you can change the amount of iteration in agent_train.py by changing the 'n' variable.

# Testing / Playing
Type in command line:

    python agent_play.py
    
The program plays one episode as a standard. If you want to change the number of episodes, change the 'n' variable in agent_play.py
